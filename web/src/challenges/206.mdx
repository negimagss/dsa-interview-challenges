### [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list)

- Iterating through the list and reversing the direction of the next pointers of the nodes.
- After the entire list is reversed, the head pointer is updated to point to the new head of the list, which was the original tail.


```js copy
/**
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var reverseList = function(head) {
    let prev = null,curr=head,next=null
    while(curr!=null){
        next = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }
    head = prev;
    return head;
};
```
